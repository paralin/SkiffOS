 ## Getting Started

 Set the comma-separated `SKIFF_CONFIG` variable:

 ```sh
 $ export SKIFF_CONFIG=pine64/rockpro64
 $ make configure                   # configure the system
 $ make compile                     # build the system
 ```

 Once the build is complete, it's time to flash the system. There are several
 approaches, please see the "Flashing" section in the [common readme].
