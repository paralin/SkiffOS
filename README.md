# SkiffOS

![](./resources/images/skiff.png)

## Introduction

Skiff is a extremely lightweight, minimal, in-memory operating system for
embedded Linux devices. It is also an intuitive and modular configuration
package manager for [Buildroot](http://buildroot.org). Theoretically, any Linux
embedded system workflow can be replicated with Skiff configuration
package sets.

Skiff loads a small ~30MB image containing the Linux kernel and critical
software (like networking/WiFi drivers) into RAM at boot-time, and never mounts
the root filesystem. This allows the system to be powered off without a graceful
shutdown with **no consequences** whatsoever. It offers **guaranteed boots and
SSH reachability** which is ideal for embedded environments.

Skiff optionally uses **docker** or **flatpak** containers for user-space
software. This allows for a highly modular and reliable system environment while
retaining the **ease-of-use** and reliability containerized systems offer.

Persistent containers, images, and data is stored on a separate filesystem
partition. The mission-critical system is then in-memory, while the persist
partition can be repaired or remounted by the parent system automatically at any
time necessary.

This repository includes configurations supporting a variety of embedded
platforms, including Raspberry Pi and ODROID boards.

## Getting started

Building a system with Skiff is easy! This example will build a basic OS for a
Pi 3.

You can type `make` at any time to see a status and help printout. Do this now,
and look at the list of configuration packages. Select which ones you want, and
set the comma-separated `SKIFF_CONFIG` variable:

```sh
$ make                             # observe status output
$ SKIFF_CONFIG=pi/3 make configure # configure the system
$ make                             # check status again
$ make compile                     # build the system
```

After you run `make configure` Skiff will remember what you selected in
`SKIFF_CONFIG`. The compile command instructs Skiff to build the system.

Once the build is complete, it's time to flash the system to a SD card. You will
need to switch to `sudo bash` for this on most systems.

```sh
$ sudo bash             # switch to root
$ blkid                 # look for your SD card's device file
$ export PI_SD=/dev/sda # make sure this is right!
$ make cmd/pi/3/format  # tell skiff to format the device
$ make cmd/pi/3/install # tell skiff to install the os
```

After you format a card, you do not need to do so again. You can call the
install command as many times as you want to update the system. The persist
partition is not touched in this step, so anything you save there, including
Docker state and system configuration, will not be touched in the upgrade.

Some operating systems are not compatible with the Skiff build system, due to
the host not using glibc, or using some outdated or otherwise incompatible
libraries for the fairly recent Skiff distribution.

If you encounter any errors related to host-* packages, you can try [building
Skiff inside Docker](./docker-build).

## Workspaces

Workspaces allow you to configure and compile multiple systems in tandem.

Set `SKIFF_WORKSPACE` to the name of the workspace you want to use.

## System Configuration

Below are some common configuration tasks that may be necessary when configuring
a new Skiff system.

### NetworkManager

Skiff uses NetworkManager to manage network connections.

Network configurations are loaded from `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`
and from `skiff/connections` on the persist partition.

The configuration file format for these connections is [documented
here](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man5/nm-settings-keyfile.5.html)
with examples.

You can use `nmcli` on the device to manage `NetworkManager`, and any connection
definitions written by `nmcli device wifi connect` or similar will automatically
be written to the persist partition and persisted to future boots.

### WiFi with WPA Supplicant

If you chose, you may configure WiFi using `wpa_supplicant` configs instead of
`NetworkManager`.

Skiff will load any wpa supplicant configs from the persist partition at
`skiff/wifi`.

Here is an example file, `wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf`. You can generate the
entries using `wpa_passphrase MyNetwork MyNetworkPassword`:

```
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
eapol_version=1
ap_scan=1
fast_reauth=1

# Put networks here.
network={
  ssid="Example_Network"
  psk=1b1069f468f6f7b2492c659802676074c3e69026e79c4d64f2c6d3d5a0ae1866
}
```

### Hostname

You can set the hostname by placing the desired hostname in the `skiff/hostname`
file on the persist partition. You could also set this in one of your config
packages by writing the desired hostname to `/etc/hostname`.

### SSH Keys

The system on boot will generate the authorized_keys file for root.

It takes SSH public key files (`*.pub`) from these locations:

 - `/etc/skiff/authorized_keys` from inside the image
 - `skiff/keys` from inside the persist partition

## Example Workloads

This section contains some example workloads you can use to get started. These
examples are Docker based. You can add the **apps/flatpak** package to your
build to enable experimental flatpak support.

### System Tools with Alpine

Alpine provides a lightweight environment with a package manager (apk) to
install developer tools on-demand. This command will execute a persistent
container named "work" which you can execute a shell inside to interact with.
This workflow is similar to how Skiff Core drops SSH sessions into Docker
containers as an optional feature.

```bash
# Replace arm32v6/alpine with alpine if on x86 or amd64 systems
docker run \
	--name=work -d \
    --pid=host --uts=host --net=host \
    --privileged \
    -v /:/root-fs -v /dev:/dev \
    --privileged \
    arm32v6/alpine:edge \
    bin/sleep 99999
    
# Execute a shell in the container.
docker exec -it work sh
```

Some useful tools to try:

 - htop: interactive process manager similar to top
 - atop: shows CPU statistics and process information as well as summaries of
   network interface load.
 - bwm-ng: simple lightweight UI to show rx/tx and total bandwidth of all interfaces.
 - bmon: detailed UI, shows all details of any network errors experienced and
   current bandwidth on all interfaces.
 - nload: shows incoming and outgoing network load.
 - nethogs: shows what processes are using network traffic.

### System Performance Monitoring with Glances

System performance monitoring and benchmarking is easy with the glances tool.

The below command can be executed after sshing to the "root" user to start the
performance monitoring UI on port 61208 on the device (for the ARM
architecture):

```bash
docker run \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  --pid=host --net=host \
  --restart=always \
  --name=glances \
  --detach=true \
  --privileged \
  paralin/glances-arm:latest glances -w
```

### Container Performance Monitoring with Cadvisor

System and container performance monitoring and benchmarking is easy with the cadvisor tool.

The below command can be executed after sshing to the "root" user to start the performance monitoring UI on port 8080 on the device:

```bash
docker run \
 --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
 --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
 --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
 --publish=8080:8080 \
 --detach=true \
 --name=cadvisor \
 braingamer/cadvisor-arm:latest
```

## Skiff Core

Users can work within a familiar, traditional, persistent OS environment if
desired. This is called the "core" user within Skiff. If this feature is
enabled:

 - On first boot, the system will build the **core** container image.
 - SSH connections to the **core** user are dropped into the Docker container
   seamlessly.
 - When building the container, the system automatically attempts to build an
   image compatible with the target.

This allows virtually any workflow to be migrated to Skiff with almost no
effort. The config file structure is flexible, and allows for any number of
containers, users, and images to be defined and built.

You may enable this by adding the config `skiff/core` to your `SKIFF_CONFIG`
list.

To customize the core environment, edit the file at `skiff/core/config.yaml` on
the persist partition. The default config will be placed there on first boot.

The default config can be overridden with a file at
`/opt/skiff/coreenv/defconfig.yaml`.

## Configuration Packages

Skiff supports modular configuration packages. A configuration directory
contains kernel configs, buildroot configs, system overlays, etc.

These packages are denoted as `namespace/name`. For example, an ODROID XU4
configuration would be `odroid/xu4`.

Configuration package directories should have a depth of 2, where the first
directory is the category name and the second is the package name.

### Package Layout

A configuration package is laid out into the following directories:

```
├── buildroot:      buildroot configuration fragments
├── buildroot_ext:  buildroot extensions (extra packages)
├── extensions:     extra commands to add to the build system
│   └── Makefile
├── hooks:          scripts hooking pre/post build steps
│   ├── post.sh
│   └── pre.sh
├── kernel:         kernel configuration fragments
├── kernel_patches: kernel .patch files
├── root_overlay:   root overlay files
├── metadata:       metadata files
│   ├── commands
│   ├── dependencies
│   ├── description
│   └── unlisted
├── resources:     files used by the configuration package
├── scripts:       any scripts used by the extensions
└── uboot_patches: u-boot .patch files
```

All files are optional.

### Out-of-tree configuration packages

You can set the following env variables to control this process:

 - `SKIFF_CONFIG_PATH_ODROID_XU4`: Set the path for the ODROID_XU4 config package. You can set this to add new packages or override old ones.
 - `SKIFF_EXTRA_CONFIGS_PATH`: Colon separated list of paths to look for config packages.
 - `SKIFF_CONFIG`: Name of skiff config to use, or comma separated list to overlay, with the later options taking precedence

These packages will be available in the Skiff system.

## Supported Systems

SkiffOS is based on Buildroot, which can compile operating systems for virtually
any machine. Therefore, SkiffOS also works on nearly any architecture or board.
